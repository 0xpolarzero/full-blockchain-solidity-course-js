# Trying out / testing

<p>To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.</p>
<p>You will need to install either <strong>npm</strong> or <strong>yarn</strong> to run the commands, and <strong>git</strong> to clone the repository.</p>

## Installation

1. Clone the whole repo:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/polar0/full-blockchain-solidity-course-js.git
   ```
2. Navigate into the subdirectory:
   ```sh
   cd 12a-nextjs-nft-marketplace-thegraph
   ```
3. Install NPM packages using `yarn` or `npm install`.

## Usage

1. You can update the contracts addresses in `constants/contractAddresses.json` to match the deployment addresses from `10-hardhat-nft-marketplace`:

```json
{
  "5": {
    "NftMarketplace": ["ethereum-goerli-marketplace-address"],
    "BasicNft": ["ethereum-goerli-nft-address"]
  },
  "80001": {
    "NftMarketplace": ["polygon-mumbai-marketplace-address"],
    "BasicNft": ["polygon-mumbai-nft-address"]
  },
  "421613": {
    "NftMarketplace": ["arbitrum-goerli-marketplace-address"],
    "BasicNft": ["arbitrum-goerli-nft-address"]
  }
}
```

To get it to work locally, you will need to navigate to `10-hardhat-nft-marketplace` to run a local node with `yarn hardhat node` and deploy the contracts with `yarn hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost`.

2. Launch the local development server with `yarn dev` or `npm run dev`.
